<h1>jot</h1>

<h2>a simple idea</h2>

<p>Recently I've found myself trying to remember what I need to do, as I often have a lot of homework. Jot is a simple website (<a href="https://liamhtml.GitHub.io/jot">here</a>) which you can use to record a few notes digitally and without creating a new text file that you have to remember to delete later. Leave this browser tab open and you can quickly reference it when you need to! Once you close the tab your notes are erased forever.</p>
  
<h2>privacy?? </h2>

<p>Jot will never store your data or notes. It's as simple as that.</p>

<h2>that's all?</h2>

<p>That's all. Jot's sole purpose is to give you a quick place to <em>jot</em> some things down.</p>

<h2>update log</h2>

<p>11/16/2020: Added "disable spellcheck" checkbox. The purpose is pretty obvious, while it is checked the <code>spellcheck</code> attribute on the <code>textarea</code> element is set to <code>false</code></p>
<p>11/16/2020: Added update log</p>
